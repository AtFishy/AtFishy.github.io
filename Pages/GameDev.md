# Game Development

This page is to display the game development I have done. This is the main focus of my course

## 2D Roguelike Prototype (Unity)

This is a prototype roguelike game for my Introduction to Game Development module in my first year. It was a rough prototype and was mostly to show important programming and design techniques I had learnt.

## 2D Maths Learning Platformer (Unity)

This was the game I developed for my second year group project. It is a simple maths based platformer design to help younger kids learning simple maths. We worked in a group of four to design and develop this.

## 3D Platformer Prototype (Unreal)

This was a prototype I developed during my Game Development Frameworks module in my second year. This was the first time I had used Unreal engine. This prototype was mostly to show new techniques I had learnt and to get more familiar with Unreal and the Blueprints it uses.
