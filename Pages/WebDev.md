# Web Development

This page is to display all the website development work I have done inside and out of university.
There are links to the websites, as well as screenshots displaying them.

## Victoria and Albert Museum API Client

This website was part of my second year web development. It is a single page application and uses vanilla JavaScript to query the V&A Museum API and display the results.

This does not work anymore as access to the API has been restricted. The JavaScript source code is still available in the website though.
